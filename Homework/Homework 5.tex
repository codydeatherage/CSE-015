\textit{Problem 1}\\

First, p and g would both need to be public
Both parties would need to agree to make both keys, p and g, public.

Both of us would do our calculations on our own, with each of us choosing a value for a

I will choose a = 5

A = $g^a$ mod p

A = $5^4$ mod 9433 = 3125

I then send my value of 6171 to you and you send me the other value for 1218.

After receiving either values we perform the final calculations:
Your Calculation: A = $3125^a$ mod 9433
My  Calculation : A = $1218^5$ mod 9433
We both then recieve the result 1051.

\textit{Problem 2}\\
Trudy and Eve would only be able to know the values of p, g, and both A values.\\

They would be unable to recover our key unless they somehow figured out both of our a values.
